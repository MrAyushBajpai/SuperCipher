# SuperCipher

This is a Manual Key Based Text Encryption Program, developed in Python language. User can pick a text based key of their liking, and use it to encrypt and decrypt messages. Messages can only be encrypted or decrypted with the same key. Using different keys for encryption and decryption will result in a faulty decryption.

## Required Modules
If You Are Using the Source Code, You Need To Install pyperclip module. Use "pip install pyperclip' in terminal. Open https://pypi.org/project/pyperclip/ for more information.

## Commands
1. **Encrypt:** Use "Encrypt" followed by the message to encrypt it using the key which you have defined earlier.
2. **Decrypt:** Use "Decrypt" followed by the message to decrypt it using the key which you have defined earlier. Using a key different from the one which was used in encryption will result in a faulty decryption.
3. **Key:** Use "Key" followed by the key to change the current key for the session. NOTE:- A Key must have 8 characters, and should NOT comprise of numeric digits.
4. **Exit/Close:** Use "Exit" or "Close" To Exit out of the program.
